A) There is a time performance difference.  HashMap outperformed MyHashMap which outperformed TreeMap

B) % differs from Math.floorMod(x,y) because % does not work for negative numbers while floor mod does
therefore making the floor mod method more reliable and more accurate.

C) the time complexity of size is O(n).  keep track of size as you add elements which would be O(1)


D) it is much more difficult to implement but its much faster although less correct.
